# LemonEngine 🍋

This is a 3D engine I made for my college project. It features a 3D scene with simple lightings, models, and shadows. 

## Features ✨
1. Support for loading 3D models that have Wavefront OBJ(.obj) format.
2. Basic lightings (Blinn phong).
3. Shadow mapping. 

## Installation ⚙

The libraries (glfw, assimp) are pre-built for minGW compiler. So you don't have to build them from scratch by yourself 😉
The headers and libraries are linked in the Codeblocks Project (.cbp) file. 

To build the program on your computer, just - 
1. Clone the repo : ```https://github.com/SmokeyTanvir/LemonEngine```.
2. Open LemonEngine.cbp using Codeblocks.
3. Build and run 😉

## Usage 🕹 
1. You can roam around the scene using keyboard and mouse.
2. Use WASD keys for movement.
3. Click on left mouse button to rotate camera.
4. There is also ImGUI UI in the Engine. You can tweak the values to see different results for the lighting and shadows. 💁‍♂️
